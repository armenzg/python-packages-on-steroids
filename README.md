# python-packages-on-steroids
Python packages for Scripts.

This is not going to be a Python package.
This is a dropping library that allows you to use any python package as it was already part of your project.
You will not have to create a virtualenv; we do that for you.
You will not have to download the packages; we do that for you.

You will simply say which packages you want and start using them like any python package.
